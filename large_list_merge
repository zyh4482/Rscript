# In some cases, software will generate hundreds of tab delimit text files under the same directory.
# If you want to merge all the tables into one single table, I find a R package for this purpose. 
# One thing to be sure is that the column should be exactly the same. 
# I'm sure python could do this easily as well, but I'm not familiar with python. Hence only R script is printed here. 

# Read all the files in the directory
setwd('path\to\files.txt')
filenames<-list.files(pattern = "*.txt")
table_list = lapply (filenames,function(x) read.table(x,header =T, sep="\t"))

# Above scripts will generate a large list with the file

install.packages("ecospace")
library(ecospace)

data=rbind_listdf(table_list)

# It will create a "data" table in the environment with rows from all files binding to a single table.
